# Smart School
The Smart School project is a comprehensive school management system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It provides features such as student information management, attendance tracking, class scheduling, fee management, and more. 

## Deployment 
To make deployment easier, the entire application is containerized using **Docker** and **Docker-Compose**. Each component (frontend, backend, and database) runs in its own container, enabling consistent environments across different stages like development, testing, and production. Docker Compose is used to manage and orchestrate these containers, simplifying the setup and scaling of the application.

## Things to Learn
Hereâ€™s a list of things I've learned from the Smart School project:

- **Creating a MERN stack application** and running it locally.
- **Containerizing** the application using **Docker** for consistent deployment.
- **Orchestrating** multiple containers using **Docker-Compose** for seamless management.
- **Running** the application in **isolated containers** for frontend, backend, and database on different ports.
- **Deploying** Docker images of the application to **DockerHub** for easy distribution.
- **Managing** image **tags** effectively using Docker for version control.
- **Networking** between containers in Docker Compose for smooth communication between services.
- **Persisting** data in containers using Docker **volumes** for the MongoDB database.
